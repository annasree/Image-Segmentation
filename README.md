# Image-Segmentation
This work explores picture segmentation with the well-known U-Net architecture for biomedical 
applications. Using the popular benchmark dataset COCO-2017, the research trains the U-Net model 
for pixel-level segmentation with the goal of precise object delineation. It includes training, assessment 
metrics, data preprocessing, and model architecture. The outcomes demonstrate U-Net's effectiveness 
in various settings, highlighting its significance in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and scene 
interpretation, and furthering the field of computer vision research.
